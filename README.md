# 🧰 Climate Data Tools & Platforms

This repo supports issue reporting for all tools in the ecosystem, including:

### 🌍 **Typical & Future Meteorological Years**  
Interactive maps that provide high-quality climate datasets for Europe and Norway:
- TMY3 Europe (continent-scale dataset)  
- TMY-NO (Norway, MET/NMBU collaboration, NS3031:2025)  
- FMY (future climate datasets for scenario robustness)

### 📊 **EPW Viewer**  
A browser-based tool for exploring EPW files and ZIP bundles with:
- Hourly time series  
- XY scatter  
- Duration curves  
- Heatmaps  
- Wind roses  
- Degree days  
- Monthly summaries  

### 🗂️ **EPW Comparison Tool**  
Compare multiple EPWs with:
- HDD/CDD  
- Timeseries  
- Duration curves  
- Percent-change analysis  
- ZIP support  

### 🗺️ **Climate Data for Buildings Websites**
- https://www.climatedataforbuildings.eu  
- https://www.klimadataforbygninger.no  

This repository is **only for issues, enhancements, and requests** related to these systems.
